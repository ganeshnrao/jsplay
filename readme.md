# JS Playground

This is a simple javascript game inspired by Apple's Swift Playground. You advance by writing javascript code to solve the puzzle.

## Installation
After you clone the repository, run `npm install` from the project's root directory, then once again from inside the `static` folder. Putting it all together you'll run the following.
```
npm install && cd static && npm install
```

## Start the game
Then run `npm start` from the root folder. Then point your browser to `http://localhost:3300` and you should be able to play the game.

## Contribute
The game has only one puzzle at the moment, but feel free to build your own puzzles and make a pull-request.
